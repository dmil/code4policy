# Pre Course Work

DPI-691M: Programming and Data for Policymakers

Welcome to "Programming and Data for Policymakers". I'm Dhrumil Mehta, your course instructor. I'm looking forward to meeting and working with everyone in January.

Since we only have a short time together in class, I have prepared some pre-work that can help us get a running start and get some logistics out of the way. Please make sure to complete the items in this todo list below before the first day of class.

## To Do

* Fill out the [pre-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSCZS-Hs4oD6yvFxUipPiEVmNv-dCM5RuZKsqKdLXWII9ZZQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you haven't already.
* Make a [github account](https://github.com/join)
* Make a [trello account](https://trello.com/invite/hkstech/68e9ac67073bcad9ad75137048ab3b2b)
* Join Slack. You should have recieved an invitation via email to join the slack team. We will use slack to communicate during the course. I will be available on Slack at least once a day until the course to answer any questions you might have with the pre-work. If you have not received the email invite, please email me.
	* Introduce yourself to the class in the `#general` channel in slack. Please also include your github username and trello username in your introduction as well as a little bit about yourself and your interest in technology.
* Do first five lessons of the CodeCademy Python Tutorial [[Lesson 1-5](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)]
	- This may take a few hours to complete. Knowing programming **is not** a prerequisite for this course, but having experience with some of the basic concepts will help things move a little more smoothly. Please set aside some time to complete the first five lessons of this tutorial before coming to class.
	- You don't have to purchase a "pro" subscription (which unlocks quizzes in the lesson). If you think the quizzes will help you better understand the content, feel free to get a one month subscription. I won't be looking at or grading the quizzes though, they are purely optional.

### Additional  Instructions for Windows Users

This course will require us to use a Unix shell which is included in the Linux and Mac operating systems. Fortunately, Microsoft has included the bash shell in the latest version of Windows 10.

* Enable Bash for Windows 10 [[instructions](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10)]

If you are an advanced user, there are a few other optional setups that will work just as well. I would only recommend these if you have time to fiddle with your computer settings and find joy in teaching your computer new tricks. You can:

1. If your computer is fast enough, run Ubuntu [inside a virtual machine](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox).
2. Run Ubuntu [off of a flash drive](https://unetbootin.github.io/).
3. [Dual boot](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) Linux and Windows on your computer.

## Suggested Readings
The suggested pre-readings for the course are on the topics of scrum and agile software development. During the course, we will discuss the benefits of agile and its adoption in delivering government services. We will also experiment with adopting some of the principles of "scrum", one of many agile and iterative software development strategies, to our learning over the course of the week of in-class instruction and into the project.

* SCRUM: A Breathtaking Brief and Agile Introduction - Chris sims and Hillary Louise Johnson] [[~20 minute read](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Breathtakingly-Brief-Agile-Introduction/dp/193796504X)]
* The Agile Manifesto [[~1 minute read](http://agilemanifesto.org/)]
* Elements of Scrum [[full book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O0U74Q/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1)]	- This reading is very optional. I would recommend the first four chapters through "Agile Values and Principles". If you're interested in knowing more about scrum though, feel free to read on and learn through google and/or youtube videos.

The kindle editions of these books are cheaper and can be read electronically on your browser through the [kindle cloud reader](https://read.amazon.com/) even if you don't own a kindle.
