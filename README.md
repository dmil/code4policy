### Your Projects!

Thanks everyone, hope you enjoyed the course! Here are the websites that your classmates made. The projects aren't meant to be super-polished, but hopefully in the course of learning how to make them you gained some valuable skills in agile software development and management, learned how to dive into unfamiliar technologies on your own, and can be scrappy with the tools you have to create working software. A special shoutout to group **A3-Criminal Justice** who I felt did a particularly good job.
